// Where a light sits in the height maps, in sprite px: `height` above its ground point, which is
// `ground` down-right of the light's screen position; rays leave it past `clear` (its own lamp,
// bowl or wall). A negative height means a creature-like source. Only the raycast mode reads it.
// A loose light is a movable item's, one anyone can drop or push there (a lit torch on the
// floor): it ranks after the map's and creatures' lights (RayLighting::pack). A transient light
// is an effect's or a missile's: it ranks after the map's lights and groups only with its kind,
