// Eases the lights MapView::drawLights gathers in and out over the frames, for either light
// sink: a light that appears (an effect, a creature walking into view) fades in, one that goes
// away fades out where it last stood, so a crowd's spells do not strobe. Lights carry no
// identity: a light continues the last frame's nearest unclaimed one of its colour and kind
// (creature, the map's, effect or missile) on its floor within MATCH_TILES (a missile in
// flight, a creature walking), and a new spell where one just ended stays lit. Each floor's
// lights are held and handed on, with the ones fading out, before the next floor's, so the
// sink's floor and shade order holds. A teleport, floor change or zoom shows the new lights at
// once.
