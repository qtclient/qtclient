// Single Windows include order for every engine TU (including those that
// /FI framework/pch.h). winsock2 before windows.h; full SDK (no
// WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN) so minizip/miniaudio see a complete surface; strip
// rpcndr's `small`/`byte` macros so CIP/C++ identifiers stay usable.

#ifndef NOMINMAX
#define NOMINMAX

// No WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN: deps need a complete SDK surface; rpcndr's `small`
// is cleared with #undef below instead of excluding headers.

#include <winsock2.h>
#include <ws2tcpip.h>
#include <windows.h>

// rpcndr.h defines `small` as a macro (char). Leave FAR/near/far alone —
// zlib's zconf.h needs FAR to stay an empty macro (undef'ing `far` turns
// `typedef Byte FAR Bytef` into a bogus identifier).
