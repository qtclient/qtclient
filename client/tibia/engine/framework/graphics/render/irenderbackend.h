 * IRenderBackend - the consumer side of the renderer boundary.
 *
 * A backend receives a RenderFrame and produces pixels. It is told WHAT to draw and decides
 * HOW; it knows nothing about pools, widgets, map floors or Lua.
 *
 * Resource plane. On OpenGL, `Texture` and `FrameBuffer` own their GL names and the GL backend
 * only resolves handles to them, so every resource hook below defaults to "nothing to do". A
 * backend that owns its native objects (WebGPU) receives pixels through `uploadTexture`,
 * creates size-only textures and render targets lazily from the handles a frame names, and
 * releases them through `destroyTexture`.
